      <p>I am 30 years old, living in San Diego with my amazing and beautiful girlfriend Kelsey. We have been together for 3 amazing years. I grew up in Massachuesetts.  I went to college at Framingham State and I got my degree in Geography. I started working in the restaurant industry since my junior year in college, and haven't gotten out of it since.  I've worked every position in the front of the house from host to manager.</p>

<p>
I moved out to San Diego with my two friends Jarrod and Jon in 2006.  Jarrod still lives out here with his wife Kate, his son Finn, and is expecting a daughter in September.  Jon moved back home after 5 months living here, and haven't heard much of him since.
</p>
<p>
I was lucky enough to meet Kelsey at work. She was the hot hostest that I had a crush on for many months until I had the guts to start talking to her. Sure enough I was able to get her to go to a Padres game with me, and since then I have been the happiest man in the world! I love her so very very much!
</p>
<p>
We live together in Golden Hill, which is just on the outskirts of downtown. We have a great view from our bedroom and balcony overlooking San Diego.
